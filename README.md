# Pong-Game

Welcome to the classic Pong Game. This project is a simple implementation of Pong game using Java

Feature:

- Two-player mode to play against friend

- A self character and background design of our team

This project serves as a fun introduction to game development using Java. It demonstrates the basic concepts of game mechanics, collision detection, and user input handling. Feel free to explore the code, modify it, and enhance the game with new features and visual improvements.

Get started:

- I have provided a java project that including all the needed java file and picture to run the game

- To use this project, include the folder in your java project or manually copy the package files into your project's source directory.
Make sure to change the package name if your is different. Open the PingPongGame file and run. It should be looking like this:

public class PingPongGame {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        GameFrame frame = new GameFrame();
    }
    
}
